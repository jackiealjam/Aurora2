  <h1>This Is Aurora's Age Of Exploration!</h1>
  <p>
    Why did the Age of Exploration began?</p><p>
It began because the European countries wanted to find routes to Chine, they wanted to find new routes to get to Chine because Ottoman Empire blocked the road to China all because of them having to deal with many wars. It also began because many countries were running out of spices to preserve their food, so they began to set explorers out to find new ways to get to China.</p>
  <p>What is the Age of Exploration?</p><p>
The Age of Exploration is a informal defined term for the early modern period from the beginning of the 15th century in European history, in which sea-faring European nations explored regions across the globe.
What was life at sea like? Why would people become sailors? </p>
<p>
The life at sea isn’t as it seems in some movies you’ve see, if you were an actual sailor it would be pretty easy, All you’d have to do was do the jobs you were assigned to do, to make it easy all you did was work, eat, sleep, and repeat, what you’d mostly eat would be steak and mash potatoes, or stuff you brought from your place, but your stuff wouldn’t last long, sometimes sailors would get scurvy from eating the same thing steak and mash potatoes. People would become sailors would be because 1 some people just wanted to get out of the house and explore because they rarely were able to leave their hometown, 2nd they’d get paid to become a sailor, and 3rd some sailors were criminals and wanted to get away or were forced to become one.

What tools were invented/used in this time?</P><p>
The tools that were invented/used at that time were Knots, magnetic compass, divider, cross-staff, sandglasses, quadrant, and an astrolabe. Knots were used to show how fast the ship was going, there would be rope attached to a piece of a log and you’d throw the rope end in the water and then pull it back and count how many knots were covered in water to see how fast you were going, and the compass would help you navigate where you were heading.  The cross-staff was a navigational tool used to measure the angle between the horizon and a celestial body such as the sun or stars. By knowing this angle, a navigator could then determine his latitude and direction, the sandglass was used to tell how much time has passed, one of the jobs as a sailor would be to keep track of time with these things. The quadrant is a very simple tool that allows the user to determine his or her latitude by measuring the altitude of a heavenly body. When used in celestial navigation or astronomy, altitude means the angle of elevation between the horizon and celestial bodies like the sun, planets, moon, or stars. An astrolabe is a device that uses astral bodies like the sun and stars to either tell your position in latitude or tell the local time. It can also be used to measure celestial events like the wobble of the Earth's axis.</p>
<p>
Who were some of the explorers? Why are they well known?</p> <p>
Some of the explorers who participated in the exploration were Simon Fraser, Henry Hudson, and John Franklin. Simon was a fur trader and an explorer, he was also best known for his great exploration of the Fraser River. Henry Hudson was an English navigator and an explorer who set outto find a passage to Japan and Chine. John was the leader for the expedition to find the passage towards the Northwest.
